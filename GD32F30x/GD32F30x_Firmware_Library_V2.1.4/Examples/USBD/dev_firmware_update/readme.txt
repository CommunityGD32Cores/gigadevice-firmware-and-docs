  This demo is based on the GD32F303E-EVAL board,it presents the implementation 
of a device firmware upgrade (DFU) capability in the GD32 USB device.

  It follows the DFU class specification defined by the USB Implementers Forum for 
reprogramming an application through USB-FS-Device.

  The DFU principle is particularly well suited to USB-FS-Device applications that 
need to be reprogrammed in the field.

  The supported memorys of this example are the internal flash memory, the external 
nand flash memory and the external nor flash memory.

  To test the demo, the internal flash is used as an example:

  Step 1: User need a configuration hex image or bin image. The hex image and the bin image 
should set application address at APP_LOADED_ADDR in the internal flash memory. User can refer to
"../Test_Images" folder and use the hex images and bin images in it.

  Step 2: User need install the corresponding GD DFU Driver with your PC operation system. 

  Step 3: Once the configuration *.hex image is generated, it can be downloaded into the 
internal flash memory or the external falsh memory using the GD tool "GD32 MCU DFUEx Tool
" available for download from http://www.gd32mcu.com/cn/download.

  The GD tool "GD32AllInOneProgrammer" can operate the option Byte in the internal flash.

  Step 4: After each device reset, hold down the TAMPER key on the GD32207i-EVAL board into app 
routine in the internal flash.
