  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use 
EXMC peripheral to control NOR memory.
  This demo shows the write and read data operation process of NOR memory by 
EXMC module. If the operation is correct, this demo will turn on LED1 and print out 
a success information and the data writed to the NOR memory. Otherwise, LED4 is 
turned on and a failure information will be printed out. Whether the operation is 
successful or not, the data read from NOR flash will be printed out.
