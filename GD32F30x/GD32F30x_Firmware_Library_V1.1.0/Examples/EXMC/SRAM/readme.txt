  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use EXMC peripheral 
to control SRAM memory.
  This demo shows the write and read data operation process of SRAM memory by 
EXMC module. If the operation is correct, LED1 will be turned on and the data read  
from the SRAM will be printed out. Otherwise, LED4 will be turned on.
  D0-D15,A0-A18,NWE,NOE,NBL0,NBL1 and NE2 must be fitted.
