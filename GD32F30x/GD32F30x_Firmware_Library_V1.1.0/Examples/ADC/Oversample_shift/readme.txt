  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use the function
of oversample and shift. In this demo, 16 times ratio of oversample and 4 bits shift
are configured. PA3(channel3) is chosen as analog input pin. The ADC conversion begins 
by software,the converted data is printed by USART.

  The analog input pin should configured to analog mode.
