  This example is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC0 to generate
a staircase-shaped signal. TIMER5 is chosen to trigger DAC0 and DMA is configured to transfer
data from memory to DAC0_R8DH. The DAC0 output pin is configured PA4. The signal can be 
observed through the oscilloscope.
