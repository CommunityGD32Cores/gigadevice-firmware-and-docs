  This example is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC concurrent mode
simultaneous trigger to generate triangle noise wave with same amplitude. TIMER5 is chosen
to trigger DAC0 and DAC1. The DAC0 output pin is configured PA4 and DAC1 output pin is configured
PA5. The triangle noise wave can be observed through the scilloscope.
