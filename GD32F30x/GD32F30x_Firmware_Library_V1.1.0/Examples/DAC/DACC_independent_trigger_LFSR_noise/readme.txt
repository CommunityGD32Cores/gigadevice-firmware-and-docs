  This example is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC concurrent mode
independent trigger to generate LFSR noise wave with different configurations. TIMER5 is 
chosen to trigger DAC0. TIMER6 is chosen to trigger DAC1. The DAC0 output pin is configured
PA4 and DAC1 output pin is configured PA5. The LFSR noise wave can be observed through the 
scilloscope.
