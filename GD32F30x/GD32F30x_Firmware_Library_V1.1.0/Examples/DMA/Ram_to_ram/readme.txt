  This example is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it provides a description 
of how to use DMA channel(1 to 4) to transfer data from RAM to RAM.DMA Channel(1 to 4) is 
configured to transfer the contents of data buffer stored in "source_address" to the 
reception buffer declared in RAM(destination_address1~destination_address4).

  The start of transfer is triggered by software. At the end of the transfer, a comparison 
between the source and destination buffers is done to check that all data have been correctly 
transferred.If transfer correctly the corresponding LED light.If transfer do not correcly,the 
corresponding LED is off.
