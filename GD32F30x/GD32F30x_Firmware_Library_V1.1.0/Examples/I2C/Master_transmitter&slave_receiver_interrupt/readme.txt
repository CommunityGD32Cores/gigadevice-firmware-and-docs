  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use the I2C interrupt 
programming mode in master transmitting mode or slave receivering mode. In this demo, 
I2C0 is operated as the master transmitter and I2C1 as the slave receiver. Moreover,
the SCL line and SDA lineof I2C0 interfaceare controled by the I/O pin PB6 and PB7 
respectively. The SCL and SDA of I2C1 are controled by the pin PB10 and PB11 respectively.

  This demo will send the data of i2c_buffer_transmitter array through I2C1 interface 
to the I2C0, and it will store the data received by I2C1 in the i2c_buffer_receiver
array. If transfer is sucessfully completed, LED1 and LED2 are on. 

  We shoud use the jumper to connect the PB6 and PB10. The PB7 and PB11 are 
connected as well.
