  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use the USART
DMA transmit and receive.
  Firstly, the USART sends the strings to the hyperterminal and then loop waiting for
receiving max 10 bytes data from the hyperterminal. Every time if the number of data you 
enter equal with or more than 10 bytes, USART will send 10 bytes to the hyperterminal.
