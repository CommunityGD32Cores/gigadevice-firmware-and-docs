  This demo is based on the GD32F30x-EVAL board, it shows how to use the USART 
transmit and receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.
  Firstly, the USART sends the strings to the hyperterminal and still waits for
receiving data from the hyperterminal. Only the number of data you enter equals with
or more than 32 bytes, USART will send strings: "USART receive successfully!" (the 
reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).
