  This demo is based on the GD32303C-START board. GD32303C-START uses GD32F303VCT6
as the main controller. It uses Mini USB interface to supply power. User button 
key, LED, USB and GD-Link are also included.

  On this board, LED is connected to PC6. After system start-up, LED is turned on
and off circularly.
