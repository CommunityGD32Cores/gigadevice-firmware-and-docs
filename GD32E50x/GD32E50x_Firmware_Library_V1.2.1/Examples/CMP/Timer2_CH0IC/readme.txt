  This demo is based on the GD323E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator trigger TIMER2 channel 0 input capture event, which is configured 
to generate an interrupt on both rising the output signal.
  In this demo,PA7(CMP0_IP)can connect to a KEYA(PA0).Each time the KEYA is pressed 
and released, the level of the comparator input pin PA7 changes, and the comparator 
output generate a rising edge.TIMER2 channel 0 capture the current value of the counter
and generate a capture interrupt.Then LED2 is on.
