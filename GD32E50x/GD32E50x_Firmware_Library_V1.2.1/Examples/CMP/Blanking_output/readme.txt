  This demo is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator blank function. Configure Timer1_CH2 as the blank source, PA7 as the
non-inverting input pin of CMP1, and PA12 as the output pin.
  In this demo,Timer1_CH0(PA0) generates a PWM signal with a 50% duty cycle, Connect 
PA0 and PA7 as CMP inputs. Blank source Timer1_CH0(PA0) generates a PWM signal with
a 5% duty cycle, use oscilloscope to observe CMP input pin and output pin at the same
time, the output signal is low level at the beginning.

  Connect PA0 to PA7.
