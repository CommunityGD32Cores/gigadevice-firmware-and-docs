  This example is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board. This example shows how to 
synchronize the Slave_TIMER0 and Slave_TIMER1. The ST0_CH0_O channel (PA8) and ST1_CH1_O
channel (PA10) output two independent PWM waveforms with a period of 1us. When a positive
pulse is generated on the external synchronous input pin(PB6), both Slave_TIMER0 and 
Slave_TIMER1 are started simultaneously and output the same waveform.

  The waveforms on pins of PA8 and PA10 can be observed by oscilloscope.
