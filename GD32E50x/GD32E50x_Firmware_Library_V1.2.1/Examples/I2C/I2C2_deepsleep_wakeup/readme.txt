  This demo is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0, it shows how to wakeup pmu from deepsleep 
mode by I2C address match. Select the IRC8M as the clock of I2C2. Press key A to 
enter deepsleep mode, led stop flashing. When the I2C received address that matches 
with its address, mcu will be wakeuped from deepsleep mode, the transfer goes on
normally and led sparks again. But the led sparks slower, because at this time IRC8M 
is the system clock.
  In this demo, I2C2 is operated as slave receiver, and the SCL line and SDA line of 
I2C2 interface are controlled by the I/O pin PA8 and PC9 respectively. 
  PA8 and PC9 should connect with a pull-up resistor.
