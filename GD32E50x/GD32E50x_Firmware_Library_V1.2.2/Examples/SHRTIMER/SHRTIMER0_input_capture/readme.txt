  This example is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board. This example shows how to 
configure capture function. The external signal is connected to the PB5 pin. The 
falling edge of the external signal triggers the capture and simultaneously reset the
counter. The period of the external signal can be calculated by capturing the value.

  The period value is printed by USART0(units: ns).
