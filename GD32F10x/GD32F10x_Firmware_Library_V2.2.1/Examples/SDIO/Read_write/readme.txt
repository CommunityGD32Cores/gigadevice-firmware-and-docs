  This example is based on the GD32103C-EVAL board, it shows how to use SDIO to read or
write to SD card. After initializing the card successfully, print out the detailed information
of the card by USART. Then write a block of data to the card and read. If any error occurs,
print the error message and turn on LED2, LED4 and turn off LED3, LED5. After that, do the
lock and unlock operation test. Lock the card first and try to erase the data of the card. 
Then unlock the card and erase the card. If any error occurs, print the error message and 
turn on LED2, LED4 and turn off LED3, LED5. Last is the multiple blocks operation test. If
no error occurs, turn on all the LEDs.

  Uncomment the macro DATA_PRINT to print out the data and display them through HyperTerminal.

  JP20 must be jumpped to SDIO.
