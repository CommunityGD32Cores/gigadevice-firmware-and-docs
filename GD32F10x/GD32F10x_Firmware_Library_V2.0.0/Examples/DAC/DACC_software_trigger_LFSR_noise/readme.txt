  This example is based on the GD32107C-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC concurrent
mode software trigger to generate LFSR noise wave with different configurations. The 
DAC0 output pin is configured PA4 and DAC1 output pin is configured PA5. The LFSR
noise wave can be observed through the oscilloscope.
