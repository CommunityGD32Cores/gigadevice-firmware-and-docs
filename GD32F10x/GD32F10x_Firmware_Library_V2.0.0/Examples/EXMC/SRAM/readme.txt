  This demo is based on the GDM3201VB Start Kit board, it shows how to use EXMC peripheral 
to control SRAM memory.

  This demo shows the write and read data operation process of SRAM memory by 
EXMC module. If the operation is correct, LED1 will be turned on and the data read  
from the SRAM will be printed out. Otherwise, LED4 will be turned on.

  SW1 must be fitted.
