  This example is based on the GD32F107C-EVAL-V1.3 board, it shows how to use the USART
DMA receive data by IDLE interrupt(the length of data is not fixed).
  Firstly, the LED2 is on and USART waiting for receiving max 256 bytes data from the 
hyperterminal. Every time if the number of data(length is not fixed) you sent from the
hyperterminal, LED2 will be toggled and the received data will be send to the hyperterminal.
  
JP5 jump to USART0.
