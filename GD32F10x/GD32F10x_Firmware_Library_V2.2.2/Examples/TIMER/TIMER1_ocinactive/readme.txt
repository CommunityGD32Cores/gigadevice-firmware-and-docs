  This demo is based on the GD32107C-EVAL board, it shows how to configure the 
TIMER peripheral to generate three different signals with three different delays.
  
  The TIMxCLK frequency is set to systemcoreclock, the prescaler is 54000, so the 
TIMER1 counter clock is 2KHz.

  And generate 3 signals with 3 different delays:
  TIMER1_CH0 delay = 2000/2000 = 1s.
  TIMER1_CH1 delay = 4000/2000 = 2s.
  TIMER1_CH2 delay = 6000/2000 = 3s.

  So PA0 is reset after a delay equal to 1s, PA1 is reset after a delay equal to 2s,
and PA2 is reset after a delay equal to 3s.

  While the counter is lower than the TIMER_CHxCV registers values, which determines
the output delay, the LED2, LED3 and LED4 are turned on. When the counter value reaches
the TIMER_CHxCV registers values, the channel output compare interrupts are generated,
and in the handler routine, these LEDs are turned off.
