  This demo is based on the GD32107C-EVAL board, it shows the I2C programming 
mode in slave transmitting mode.In this demo,I2C0 is operated as slave 
transmitter,and the SCL line and SDA line of I2C0 interface are controled by 
the I/O pin PB6 and PB7 respectively.

  This demo shows the sending data process of the slave. And it will send the 
data in the i2c_transmitter array through the I2C0.
  
  The demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no specific 
master.In the specific application, we need config the master to start a data 
transmission.In addition,the master and the slave may need to be connected by 
the jumper if necessary.When the macro I2C_10BIT_ADDRESS is 1, I2C communicate in 
10 bit addressing mode, otherwise, I2C communicate in 7 bit addressing mode.

  P4 must be fitted.
