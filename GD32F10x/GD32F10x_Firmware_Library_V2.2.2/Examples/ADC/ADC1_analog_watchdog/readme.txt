  This demo is based on the GD32107C-EVAL-V1.3 board, it shows how to use the ADC analog
watchdog to guard continuously an ADC channel. The ADC is configured in continuous mode,
the ADC1 clock is configured to 27MHz. PC3 is chosen as analog input pin.

  Change the VR1 on the board, and measure TP2 pad, when the channe13 converted value is 
over the programmed analog watchdog high threshold (value 0x0A00) or below the analog 
watchdog low threshold(value 0x0400), an WDE interrupt will occur, and LED2 will be on.
When the channe13 converted value is in safe range(among 0x0400 and 0x0A00), the LED2 
will be off.

  The analog input pin should be configured to AIN mode.
