  This demo is based on the GD32W515P-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use the ADC to 
convert analog signal to digital data.The ADC is configured in dependent mode, inner 
channel9 (temperature sensor channel), channel10 (VREF channel) and channel11 (VBAT/4
channel) are chosen as analog input pin.

  As the AD convertion begins by software,the converted data in the ADC_IDTRx register, 
where the x is 0 to 2.

  We can watch temperature, vref_value and vbat_value in debug mode or by COM.
