  This example is based on the GD32W515P-EVAL-V1.1 board, it provides a description
of I2S play audio synchronously by HPDF. In this demo, HPDF is used to sample audio 
data of PDM microphone. The sampling rate of audio is 16KHz. The PDM data will be 
played by I2S synchronously.

  On the GD32W515P-EVAL-V1.1 board, Plugging in earphone and sounds in the environment
