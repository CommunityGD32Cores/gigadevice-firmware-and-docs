  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use the I2C 
interrupt programming mode in master receiving mode or slave transmitting mode.
In this demo, I2C0 is operated as the master receiver and I2C1 as the slave 
transmitter. Moreover,the SCL line and SDA line of I2C0 interface are controled 
by the I/O pin PB6 and PB7 respectively. The SCL and SDA of I2C1 are controled 
by the pin PB10 and PB11 respectively.

  This demo will send the data of i2c_buffer_transmitter array through I2C1 interface 
to the I2C0, and it will store the data received by I2C0 in the i2c_buffer_receiver
array. If transfer is sucessfully completed, LED2 and LED3 are on. 

  We shoud use the jumper to connect the PB6 and PB10. The PB7 and PB11 are 
connected as well.
  JP16 must be fitted.
