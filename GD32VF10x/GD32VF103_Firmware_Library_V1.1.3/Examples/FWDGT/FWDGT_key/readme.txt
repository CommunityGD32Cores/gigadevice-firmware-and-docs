  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to reload the 
FWDGT counter at regulate period using the EXTI interrupt. The FWDGT timeout 
is set to 1.6s (the timeout may varies due to IRC40K frequency dispersion).
 
  An EXTI is connected to a specific GPIO pin and configured to generate an interrupt
on its falling edge: when the EXTI Line interrupt is triggered (by pressing the Key_B 
on the board), the corresponding interrupt is served. In the ISR, FWDGT counter is 
reloaded). As a result, when the FWDGT counter is reloaded, which prevents any FWDGT 
reset,  LED2 or LED3 remains illuminated.
  
  If the EXTI Line interrupt does not occur, the FWDGT counter is not reloaded before
the FWDGT counter reaches 00h, and the FWDGT reset. If the FWDGT reset is generated, 
LED2 and LED3 are turned off with the system reset. FWDGTRST flag is set by hardware,
and then LED3 is turned on.
