  This example is based on the GD32VF103V, it shows SPI0 and SPI1 fullduplex 
communication with nssp mode. After the communicate is complete, if the receive data 
equals to send data, LED2 and LED3 turn on, if not, LED2 and LED3 turn off.

  Connect SPI0 NSS  PIN(PA4) to SPI1 NSS  PIN(PB12)
  Connect SPI0 SCK  PIN(PA5) to SPI1 SCK  PIN(PB13)
  Connect SPI0 MISO PIN(PA6) to SPI1 MISO PIN(PB14)
  Connect SPI0 MOSI PIN(PA7) to SPI1 MOSI PIN(PB15)
