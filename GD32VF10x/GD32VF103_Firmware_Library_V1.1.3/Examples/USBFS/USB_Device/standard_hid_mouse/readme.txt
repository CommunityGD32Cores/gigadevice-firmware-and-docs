  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides a description of 
how to use the USB_FS device application based on the Human Interface Device (HID).

  The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses a 48MHz clock, which is generated 
from an integrated PLL.

  The GD32 device is enumerated as an USB mice, that uses the native PC Host
HID driver to which the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board is connected.

  The USB mice use four key(A key, B key, C key and D key) to move the cursor.

  This demo supports remote wakeup (which is the ability of a USB device to 
bring a suspended bus back to the active condition), and the CET key is 
used as the remote wakeup source.

  In order to test USB remote wakeup function, you can do as follows:
    - Manually switch PC to standby mode

    - Wait for PC to fully enter the standby mode

    - Push the CET key

    - If PC is ON, remote wakeup is OK, else failed

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
    - Open your preferred tool-chain 

    - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory

    - Run the application
