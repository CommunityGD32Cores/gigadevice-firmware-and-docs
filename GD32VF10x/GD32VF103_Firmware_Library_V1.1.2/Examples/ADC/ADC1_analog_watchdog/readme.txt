  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-1.0 board, it shows how to use the ADC analog
watchdog to guard continuously an ADC channel. The ADC is configured in continuous mode,
PC3 is chosen as analog input pin.

  Change the VR1 on the GD32V103V-EVAL-1.0 board, measure TP2 pad on the GD32VF103V-EVAL board,
when the channe113 converted value is over the programmed analog watchdog high threshold (value
0x0A00) or below the analog watchdog low threshold(value 0x0400), an WDE interrupt will occur,
and LED2 will be on. When the channe113 converted value is in safe range(among 0x0400 and 0x0A00),
the LED2 will be off.

  The analog input pin should be configured to AIN mode.
