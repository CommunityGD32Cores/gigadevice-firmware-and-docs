  This example is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to generate 
the interrupt request, and toggle the LED. After the system start-up, LED2 is on. 
When Key B is pressed, LED3 is toggled, it is switched on; when Key B is pressed 
once again, LED3 is toggled, it is switched off.

  On the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, LED1 connected to PC0, LED2 connected to PC2, LED3
connected to PE0, LED4 connected to PE1.
