  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-1.0 board, it shows how to convert ADC 
regular and inserted group channels using EXTI external trigger.

  The inserted group length is 4, the scan mode is set, every rising edge event of 
EXTI15(PD15) will trigger ADC to convert all the channels in the inserted group. 
When all inserted group channels are converted, EOIC interrupt will be generated.
The inserted datas are print by USART.

  The regular group length is 4. Every rising edge event of EXTI11(PD11) converts 4 
channels and DMA can be used to transfer the converted data.

   We can watch array adc_value[]/inserted_data[] in debug mode or by COM.
   JP5 and JP6 jump to USART.
