  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows that, when the TIMER1_HOLD
bit in DBG control register(DBG_CTL) is set and the core halted, the TIMER1 counter stop 
counting and the PWM outputs of all channels are stopped as well. It's benefit for debuging.

  The TIMER1 counter clock used is 1MHz.
The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 25%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 50%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 75%.

  Connect the TIMER1 pins to an oscilloscope and monitor the different waveforms:
- TIMER1_CH1  pin (PB3)
- TIMER1_CH2  pin (PB10)
- TIMER1_CH3  pin (PB11)

  In debug mode, when the core is stopped, the PWM outputs of all the channels of 
TIMER1 will be stopped.
