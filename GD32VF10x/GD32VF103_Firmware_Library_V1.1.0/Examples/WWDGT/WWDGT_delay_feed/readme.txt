  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows the WWDGT with different
counter value and window value make the different WWDGT timeout. As a result, LED1 
and LED2 display a different phenomenon.

  In this demo, the WWDGT counter value is set to 127, the refresh window is set to 
80. In this case the WWDGT timeout is set to 38.8ms(the timeout may varies due to 
APB1 frequency dispersion), the value in the delay function is set to 30ms, the WWDGT 
counter can reloaded normally, the LED2 is turn off, LED3 is blinking fast.
  
  If the value in the delay function is not set properly, the WWDGT counter is not 
reloaded. As a result, the system reset and only the LED2 is remain illuminated.
  
  In this example the system clock is set to 108 MHz , and the APB1 is set to 54MHz.
