  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it explains how to configure the
RTC module. In this demo, RTC peripheral is configured to display calendar.
Select LXTAL as RTC clock source. And the HyperTerminal should be connected to the 
evaluation board via COM0.
  After start-up,if the BKP data register is written to a key value. If the value 
is incorrect, the program will ask to set the time on the HyperTerminal. If the
key value is correct, the calendar will be displayed on the HyperTerminal. 
  The RTC module is in the Backup Domain, and is not reset by the system reset.
