  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides a description 
of how to use the I2C bus to write and read EEPROM. The access result will be 
printed by COM.

  Procedures sequentially writes 256 bytes of data to the EEPROM from the 0x00 
address, and then the program sequentially reads 256 bytes of data from the 
EEPROM from the 0x00 address. Compare the written data and read data, if they 
are same, "I2C-AT24C02 test passed!" will be printed and the four LED lights
on the board start flashing. Otherwise, "Err:data read and write aren't matching."
will be printed and the four LEDs light will turn on.

  JP5 and JP6 must be fitted to USART. JP16 must be fitted to I2C.
