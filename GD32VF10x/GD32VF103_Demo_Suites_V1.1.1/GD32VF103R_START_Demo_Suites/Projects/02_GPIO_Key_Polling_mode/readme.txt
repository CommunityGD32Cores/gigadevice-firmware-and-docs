  This demo is based on the GD32VF103R-START-V1.0 board, LED1 is connected to PA7. LED2 is
connected to PA8. LED3 is connected to PA10. LED4 is connected to PC13. Then, four LEDs 
are turned on and off for test. The User key is connected to PA0. It provides a description 
to use the key to control the LED by the polling mode. The user can toggle the output state of 
LED1 by pressing the User key.
