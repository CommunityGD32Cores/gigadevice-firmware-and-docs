  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3 board, it shows how to configure the 
ADC peripheral to convert the analog signal to digital data. ADC is configured 
in independent mode, PC1(channel11) is chosen as analog input pin. The ADC clock
is configured to 12MHz(below 14MHz). The CH1 event of TIMER1(the frequence is 60kHz)
is used as the trigger source of ADC. So the conversion frequence of ADC is also 60kHz.

  The converted data in the ADC RDATA register is moved into SRAM(through DMA).

  The analog input pin should configured to analog mode and the ADC clock should be
below 14MHz.
