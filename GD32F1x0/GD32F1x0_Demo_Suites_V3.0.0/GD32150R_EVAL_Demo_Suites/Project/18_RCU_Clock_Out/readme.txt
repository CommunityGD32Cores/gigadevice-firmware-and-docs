  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3 board, it shows how to use RCU clock out function. 
When program is running, user could press the user key to select different clock output mode.
Demo has seven clock output mode. Once the key is pressed, the next mode will be selected and 
corresponding led will light. Debug information can be printed from COM by using USART0. The
clock output pins are configured PA8.
