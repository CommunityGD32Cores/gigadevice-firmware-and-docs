  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3 board, it provides a description of how
to use the SPI to drive TFT LCD and block write and read in TF card. 

  After system start-up, all the LEDs are turned on and then turned off for test.
After that, the LCD panel is cleared to blue. If the initialization of SD card is
right, write and read 2048 bytes on address 0. If not, show the fail information
on the LCD screen. Then check the correctness of written and read data.
Whether the two buffers are the same or not, show the result on the LCD screen.
