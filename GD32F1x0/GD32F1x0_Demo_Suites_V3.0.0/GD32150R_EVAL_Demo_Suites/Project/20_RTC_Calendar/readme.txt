  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3 board, it explains how to configure the RTC 
module. In this demo, RTC peripheral is configured to keep time.

  The RTC clock source is chosen to IRC40K in main file.

  After start-up, the four LEDs turn on, then turn off. And then the LCD prints out the
information of the borad, the time, and refreshes the time. When the wakeup key is pressed,
the time is configured to 2016-05-13,12:00:00.
