  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/ GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows the I2C 
programming mode in master transmitting mode.In this demo, BOARD_I2C is operated as the 
master transmitter, and the SCL line and SDA line of BOARD_I2C interface are controled 
by the I/O pin PB10 and PB11(or PB6 and PB7) respectively.

  This demo shows the sending process of the master. And it will send the data 
in the i2c_transmitter array through BOARD_I2C.

  The demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no specific 
slave. In the specific application, we must send the correct slave address, and the 
master and the slave may need to be connected by the jumper if necessary.
