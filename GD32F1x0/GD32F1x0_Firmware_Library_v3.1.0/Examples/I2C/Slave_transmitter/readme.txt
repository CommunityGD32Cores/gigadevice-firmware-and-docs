  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/ GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows the 
I2C programming mode in slave transmitting mode.In this demo,BOARD_I2C is operated 
as slave transmitter,and the SCL line and SDA line of I2C0 interface are controled 
by the I/O pin PB10 and PB11(or PB6 and PB7) respectively.

  This demo shows the sending data process of the slave. And it will send the 
data in the i2c_transmitter array through the BOARD_I2C.

  The demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no specific 
master.In the specific application, we need config the master to start a data 
transmission.In addition,the master and the slave may need to be connected by 
the jumper if necessary.When the macro I2C_10BIT_ADDRESS is 1, I2C communicate in 
10 bit addressing mode, otherwise, I2C communicate in 7 bit addressing mode.
