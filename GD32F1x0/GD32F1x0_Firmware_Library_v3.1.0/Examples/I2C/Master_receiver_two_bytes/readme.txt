  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows the I2C 
programming mode in master receiving mode which the master only want to receive 
two bytes of data. In this demo, BOARD_I2C is operated as master receiver,and the 
SCL line and SDA line of BOARD_I2C interface are controled by the I/O pin PB10 and \
PB11(or PB6 and PB7) respectively.

  This demo shows the receiving two bytes process of the master. And it will store 
the received data in the i2c_receiver array.

  This demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no 
specific slave.In the specific application, we must send the correct slave 
address, and the master and the slave may need to be connected by the jumper 
if necessary.
