  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to use 
USART to wake up the MCU from deepsleep mode.
  In this demo, the wake up method is configured as start bit detection. When the MCU
enters into deepsleep mode, LED2 stops in a certain status(on or off). In this 
case, you can send some characters to wake up USART and LED2 goes on blink.
