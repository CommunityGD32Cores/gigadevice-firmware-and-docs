  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to use the USART 
to detect and automatically set the USARTx_BRR value based on the reception of 
one character. 
  In this demo, firstly, the USART sends "\n\rUSART auto baudrate detection example\n\r"
to the hyperterminal USART_ABDM_FTOF is set as the auto baud rate detection mode. If auto
baud rate detection is completed without error, LED1 is on.
   You can send any character be in a start 10xxxxxx frame format 1(eg.0x0a or 0x01)
to implement the auto baud rate detection.
