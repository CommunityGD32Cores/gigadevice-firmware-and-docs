  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to use the USART
DMA transmit and receive.
  Firstly, the USART sends the strings to the hyperterminal and then loops waiting for
receiving max 10 datas from the hyperterminal. Every time if the number of data you enter is
equal to or more than 10 bytes, USART will send 10 bytes to the hyperterminal.
