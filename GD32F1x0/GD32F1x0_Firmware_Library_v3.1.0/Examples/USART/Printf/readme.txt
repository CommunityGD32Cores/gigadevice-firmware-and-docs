  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to retarget the C 
library printf function to the USART.

  The USARTx is configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
