  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL, it shows how to use USART receiver 
timeout function.  
  Firstly, the USART sends "a usart receive timeout test example!" to the hyperterminal
and then loops waiting for receiving data from the hyperterminal. If you do not enter any
data more than 3 seconds, USART will send strings to the hyperterminal what you have entered
and start a new round of waiting.
