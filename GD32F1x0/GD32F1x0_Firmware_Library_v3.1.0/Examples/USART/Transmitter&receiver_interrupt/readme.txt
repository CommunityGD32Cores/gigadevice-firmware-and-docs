  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to use 
the USART transmit and receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.
  Firstly, the USART sends the strings to the hyperterminal and still waits for
receiving data from the hyperterminal. Only the number of data you enter is equal to
or more than 32 bytes, USART will send strings: "USART receive successfully!" (the 
reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).
