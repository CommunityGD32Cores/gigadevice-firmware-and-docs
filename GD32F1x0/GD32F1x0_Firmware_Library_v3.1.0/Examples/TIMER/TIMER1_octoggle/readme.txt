  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to
configure the TIMER peripheral to generate the toggle signal.
  
  The TIMxCLK frequency is set to systemcoreclock (72MHz), the prescaler is 3600
so the TIMER1 counter clock is 20KHz.
  
  TIMER1 configuration: output compare toggle mode:
  CH1 update rate = TIMER1 counter clock / CH1VAL = 20000/4000 = 5 Hz. 

  Connect the TIMER1 CH1 pin(PB3) to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.
