  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/ GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to
use the ADC discontinuous mode.The ADC is configured in discontinuous mode, group length
is 8,conversion length is 3, using software trigger. Every trigger convert 3 channels.
The ADC clock is configured to 12MHz(below 14MHz or 28MHz).

  You can use the watch window to see the conversion result.
