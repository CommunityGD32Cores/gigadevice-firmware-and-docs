  This demo is based on the GD32190R-EVAL board. It will show how to use the
OPA2 to amplify the input voltage.The input voltage is connected to the JP8 Pin 1.
The amplifier output pin can be configured to the ADC sample channel 13. We can adjust
the VR2 to change the magnification. The amplified voltage can be measured on the
JP8 pin 2 with a universal meter or oscilloscope. Amplified voltage can also be
sampled by ADC1 and printed out through the serial port.
