  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3/GD32190R-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows how to
configure the comparator input switch. In this demo, input 3.3V(GD32150R) or 5V
(GD32190R) to PA4, turn on comparator input switch, then PA4 will be connected to 
CMP1_IP. After system start-up, enable comparator, then LED2 is on.

  Connect PA4 to +3V3(GD32150R) or +5V(GD32190R).
  Connect PA6 to PC11(GD32150R) or PA12(GD32190R).
