  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3/GD32190R-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows how to 
  control PWM output by using comparator output

  - CMP channel0 is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
  - Non Inverting input is connected to PC1(GD32150R)/PC0(GD32190R)
  - Output is internally connected to TIMER1 OCREFCLR (output compare reference clear)

  - While PC1/PC0 is lower than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PB3 
  - While PC1/PC0 is higher than VREFINT, PB3 is displayed in low level.

  Connect PA1 to PC1(GD32150R)/PC0(GD32190R).
