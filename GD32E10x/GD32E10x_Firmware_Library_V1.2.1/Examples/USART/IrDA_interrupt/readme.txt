  This demo is based on the GD32M3203Z-EVAL board, it provides a basic communication USART1 
whith USART2 in IrDA mode.

  The txbuffer is sent by USART1. USART2 receives data and stores in rxbuffer. If the data 
received by USART2 is equal to txbuffer, LED2 and LED3 will be turned on. Otherwise, LED4 and
LED5 will be turned on.

  JP16 and JP15 must be fitted. Unplug jumper cap conneted to PA2, PA3, PB10 and PB11 such as
JP13, JP14 and JP20.
