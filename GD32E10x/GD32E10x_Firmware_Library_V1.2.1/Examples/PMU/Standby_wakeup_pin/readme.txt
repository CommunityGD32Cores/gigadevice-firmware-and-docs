  This example is based on the GD32E103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows pmu how to enter standby mode 
and wakeup it. 

  Connect the CK_OUT0 pin (PA8) to an oscilloscope to monitor the CK_SYS frequency.

  Step 1: When the board is start up, all of the LEDs are on and the oscilloscope shows that 
the frequency of CK_SYS is 120M Hz.

  Step 2: Press tamper key to enter standby mode. All of the LEDs are off and there is no waveform 
on the oscilloscope.

  Step 3: Press wakeup key. Mcu will be wakeuped from standby mode and LEDs will be turn on again. 
When exit from the standby mode, a power-on reset occurs and the mcu will execute instruction code 
from the 0x00000000 address. So the SystemInit() function will be reconfigured. The oscilloscope 
shows that the frequency of CK_SYS is 120M Hz.
