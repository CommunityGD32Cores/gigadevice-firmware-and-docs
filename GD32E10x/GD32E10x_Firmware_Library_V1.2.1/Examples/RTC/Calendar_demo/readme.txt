  This demo is based on the GD32E103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it explains how to configure 
the RTC module. In this demo, RTC peripheral is configured to display calendar.

  Select LXTAL as RTC clock source. And the HyperTerminal should be connected to the 
evaluation board via COM1.

  After start-up, the program checks whether the BKP data register is written in a 
key value or not. 

  The register has not yet been programmed when the program is executed for the first 
time. At this time, the RTC will be configured. The user will be asked to set the date 
and time on the HyperTerminal. And the calendar will be displayed on the LCD.

  If a power on reset or an external reset occurs, and the BKP domain is not reset. 
RTC does not need to be configured and the value of the calendar will be continued with 
the value before reset.

  Press the USER key, all LEDs will be toggle after 10s.

  P2 and P3 must be fitted to the EXMC port.

  JP23 must be installed a LCD device.
