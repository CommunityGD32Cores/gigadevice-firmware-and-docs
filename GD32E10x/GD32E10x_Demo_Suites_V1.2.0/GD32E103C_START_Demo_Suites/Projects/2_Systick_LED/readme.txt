  This demo is based on the GD32E103C-START board. GD32E103C-START uses GD32E103C8T6
as the main controller. It uses Mini USB interface to supply power. User button 
key, LED, USB and GD-Link are also included.

  On this board, LED is connected to PA8. After system start-up, LED2 is turned on
and off circularly.
