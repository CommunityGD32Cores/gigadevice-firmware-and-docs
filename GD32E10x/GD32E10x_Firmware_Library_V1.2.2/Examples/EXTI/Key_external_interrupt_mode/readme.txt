  This demo is based on the GD32E103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to generate 
the interrupt request, and toggle the LED. After the system start-up, 
LED2~LED5 is on. When wakeup key is pressed, LED3 is toggled; 
when tamper key is pressed once again, LED4 is toggled,
when user key is pressed once again, LED5 is toggled.
