  This demo is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator trigger interrupt using an external interrupt line. In this demo, EXTI line 
21 is configured to generate an interrupt on both rising edge and falling edge of the 
output signal.

 CMP is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.2V
  - Non Inverting input is connected to PA1
  - Output is internally connected to EXTI line 21

- While PA1 is lower than VREFINT (1.2V),LED2 is off.
- While PA1 is higher than VREFINT, LED2 is on.
