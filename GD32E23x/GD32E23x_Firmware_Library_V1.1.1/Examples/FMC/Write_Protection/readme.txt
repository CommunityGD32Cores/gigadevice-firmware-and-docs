  This example is based on the GD32E230C-EVAL-V1.1 board, it provides a description 
of how to enable and disable the write protection for the embedded flash.
    
  After system start-up, LED1 is lighted. It indicates that no pages of flash are in write 
protection and all pages can be erased/programmed successfully. 
    
  STEP1: Press the key Wakeup. The LED1 will be off and LED2 will be on. It indicates that 
some pages are in write protection and erasing/programming on them is failed.

  STEP2: Press the key Tamper. The LED1 will be on and LED2 will be off. It indicates that 
some pages are out of write protection and can be erased/programmed successfully.
