  This demo is based on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1, it shows how to
use ADC0, ADC1 and ADC2 inserted_parallel convert function.PA0/PA1
/PA2/PA3/PA4/PF7 are configured as AN mode.TIMER1_CH0 is the trigger 
source of ADC0.ADC1 and ADC2 external trigger is disabled.When the 
rising edge of TIMER1_CH0 coming,ADC0, ADC1 and ADC2 inserted channel 
are triggered at the same time.The values of ADC0,ADC1 and ADC2 are 
transmit to array adc_value[] by DMA.
  We can watch array adc_value[] in debug mode or by COM0.Also we can 
watch array adc_value[] in debug mode.

  ADC0: PA0(ADC0_IN0),PA3(ADC0_IN3) 
  ADC1: PA1(ADC1_IN1),PA4(ADC1_IN4)
  ADC2: PA2(ADC2_IN2),PF7(ADC2_IN5)
