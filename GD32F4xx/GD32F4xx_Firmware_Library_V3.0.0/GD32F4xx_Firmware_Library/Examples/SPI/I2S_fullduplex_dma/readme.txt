  This demo is based on GD32F4xx, it shows I2S1 and I2S2 fullduplex communication use dma mode. 
After the communicate is complete, if receive data equal tosend data, led1 and led2 turn on. If 
not, led1 and led2 turn off.

  Connect I2S1 WS PIN(PB12)     TO  I2S2 WS PIN(PA15).
  Connect I2S1 CK PIN(PB13)     TO  I2S2 CK PIN(PB3).
  Connect I2S1 SD PIN(PB15)     TO  I2S2 SD PIN(PB5).
  Connect I2S1_ADD SD PIN(PB14) TO  I2S2_ADD SD PIN(PB4).
