  This demo shows how to use EXMC peripheral to control SRAM memory. It describes
the write and read data operation process of SRAM memory by EXMC module. If the 
operation is correct, LED1 will be turned on and the data read from the SRAM will be 
printed out. Otherwise, LED4 will be turned on.
  D0-D15,A0-A18,NWE,NOE,NBL0,NBL1 and NE2 must be fitted.
