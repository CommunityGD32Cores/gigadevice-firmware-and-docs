  This example shows how to use DAC concurrent mode output voltage. No trigger source 
is chosen to trigger DAC. The DAC0 output pin is configured PA4 and DAC1 output pin is 
configured PA5. There are two different voltage in PA4 and PA5. The voltage of PA4 is 
VREF/2 and the voltage of PA5 is VREF/8.
