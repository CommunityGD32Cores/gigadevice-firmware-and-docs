  This example shows how to use DAC concurrent mode independent trigger to generate LFSR 
noise wave with different configurations. TIMER5 is chosen to trigger DAC0. TIMER6 is chosen 
to trigger DAC1. The DAC0 output pin is configured PA4 and DAC1 output pin is configured PA5. 
The LFSR noise wave can be observed through the scilloscope.
