  This demo is based on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to
use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously an ADC channel.
The ADC is configured in continuous mode, PA3 is chosen as analog
input pin. Connect PA3 to PF6.

  Change the VR1 on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, measure TP2 pad on the 
GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, when the channel3 converted value is over the 
programmed analog watchdog high threshold (value 0x0A00) or below 
the analog watchdog low threshold(value 0x0400), an WDE interrupt 
will occur, and LED2 will be turned on. When the channel3 converted 
value is in safe range(among 0x0400 and 0x0A00), the LED2 will be 
turned off. 

  The analog input pin should configured to AN mode.We can watch 
adc_value in debug mode or by COM.
