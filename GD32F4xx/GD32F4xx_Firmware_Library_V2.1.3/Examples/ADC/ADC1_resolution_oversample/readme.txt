  This demo is based on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to use the funciton
of resolusion modification and oversample. In this demo, 12B and 6B resolusion
work with the shift and ratio of oversample. PA3(channel3) is chosen as analog 
input pin.
  
  As the AD conversion begins by software,the converted data is printed by USART.
So we can directly see the difference between high resolution and low resolution
, shift and ratio of oversample.

  The analog input pin should configured to analog mode.
