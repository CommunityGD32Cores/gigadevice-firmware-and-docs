  This example is based on the GD32450I-EVAL-V1.1 board, it provides a
description of how to erase and program flash memory. 

  After reset, the flash program erase controller is locked. To unlock it,
the fmc_unlock() function is used.
  Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase sector feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of sector to be used. Then the sector will be erased.
  Once this erase operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed using  
the word/halfword/byte programming function. 
  At each stage, serial print the corresponding information.
