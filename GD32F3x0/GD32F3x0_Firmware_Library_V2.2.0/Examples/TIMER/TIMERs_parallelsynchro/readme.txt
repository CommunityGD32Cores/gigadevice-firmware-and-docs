  This demo is based on the GD32F350R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to synchronize 
TIMER peripherals in parallel mode.
  
  In this example three timers are used:
  1/TIMER14 is configured as master timer:
  - PWM mode is used.
  - The TIMER14 update event is used as trigger output.

  2/TIMER2 is slave for TIMER14, 
  - PWM mode is used.
  - The ITR2(TIMER14) is used as input trigger.
  - external clock mode is used, the counter counts on the rising edges of
  the selected trigger.

  3/TIMER0 is slave for TIMER14, 
  - PWM mode is used.
  - The ITR0(TIMER14) is used as input trigger.
  - external clock mode is used, the counter counts on the rising edges of
  the selected trigger.
 
  The TIMERxCLK is fixed to 84MHz(GD32F330) or108MHz(GD32F350), the TIMER14 counter clock is:
72MHz/4200(GD32F330)or 5400(GD32F350)= 20KHz.

  The master timer TIMER14 CH1(PA2) is running at TIMER14 frequency:
  TIMER14 frequency = (TIMER14 counter clock)/ (TIMER14 period + 1) = 5 Hz 
and the duty cycle = TIMER14_CH0CV/(TIMER14_CAR + 1) = 50%

  The TIMER2 CH0(PA6) is running:
  - At (TIMER14 frequency)/ (TIMER2 period + 1) = 5 Hz and a duty cycle
  equal to TIMER2_CH0CV/(TIMER2_CAR + 1) = 50%

  The TIMER0 CH0(PA8) is running:
  - At (TIMER14 frequency)/ (TIMER0 period + 1) = 5 Hz and a duty cycle
  equal to TIMER2_CH0CV/(TIMER2_CAR + 1) = 50%
