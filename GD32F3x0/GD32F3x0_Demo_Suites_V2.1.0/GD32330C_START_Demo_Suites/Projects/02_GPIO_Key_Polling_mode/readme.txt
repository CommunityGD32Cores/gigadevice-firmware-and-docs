  This demo is based on the GD32330C-START-V1.0 board. GD32330C-START uses GD32F330CBT6
as the main controller. It uses Mini USB interface to supply power. User button key, 
LED and GD-Link are also included.
  On the board, LED1 is connected to PF6 and LED2 is connected to PF7. User Key is 
connected to PA0. Download the program to the board, LED1 and LED2 are turned on and 
off for test. The user can toggle the output state of LED1 by pressing the User key.
