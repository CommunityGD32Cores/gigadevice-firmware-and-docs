  This example is based on the gd32l301K-START-V1.1 board, it shows how to use EXTI line
9 to trigger DAC_OUT. The DAC_OUT output pin is configured PA4. Connect one key and 
GPIO PA9 with Dupont line. 

  Press the key for many times, the variations of the wave can be observed through the 
oscilloscope.
