  This demo is based on the GD32L233R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use the ADC analog 
watchdog to guard continuously an ADC channel. The ADC is configured in continuous mode, 
PA1 is chosen as analog input pin.

  Change the VR1 on the GD32L233R-EVAL-V1.0 board, when the channel1 converted value is 
over the programmed analog watchdog high threshold (value 0x0A00) or below the analog 
watchdog low threshold(value 0x0400), an WDE interrupt will occur, and LED1 will turn on.
When the channel1 converted value is in safe range(among 0x0400 and 0x0A00), the LED1 
will be off.

  The analog input pin should be configured to AIN mode.
