  This demo is based on the GD32205R-START board. GD32205R-START uses GD32F205RET6
as the main controller. It uses Mini USB interface or DC-005 connector to supply power.
User button key, LED, USB and GD-Link are also included.

  On the board, the User key connects to PA0 and the LED connects to PC6. It provides
a method to use the key for controlling the LED by the interrupt. The user can toggle 
the output state of LED by pressing the User key.
