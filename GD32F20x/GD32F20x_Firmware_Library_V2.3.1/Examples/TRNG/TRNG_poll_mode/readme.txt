  This demo is based on the GD32207i-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows how to use the TRNG 
peripheral to generate random 32bit numbers. After the system start-up, 
LED2 is on. if application initialize the TRNG module successfully, it will 
print success message using USART to PC HyperTerminal, otherwise it will 
print error message. When Tamper Key is pressed, application trys to get the 
random 32bit number and print the data to PC HyperTerminal.

  JP5 must be jumpped to USART.
