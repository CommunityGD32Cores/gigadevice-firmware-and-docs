  This example is based on the GD32207i-EVAL board, it shows how to use DAC concurrent mode
output voltage. No trigger source is chosen to trigger DAC. The DAC0 output pin is configured
PA4 and DAC1 output pin is configured PA5. There are two different voltage in PA4 and PA5. The
voltage of PA4 is VREF/2 and the voltage of PA5 is VREF/8.
