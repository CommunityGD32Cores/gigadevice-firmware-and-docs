  This example is based on the GD32207i-EVAL board, it shows how to use EXTI line 9 
to trigger DAC0. The DAC0 output pin is configured PA4. Connect one key (PA0 for 
example) and GPIO PE9 with Dupont line. Press the key (Wakeup for example) for many 
times, the variations of the wave can be observed through the oscilloscope.
