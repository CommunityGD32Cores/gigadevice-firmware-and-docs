  This demo is based on the GD32207i-EVAL, it shows how to use the HAU
peripheral to hash data using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms.
  The SHA-1 message digest result is a 160 bit data and the MD5 message digest result 
is a 128 bit data.
  The all result data can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the USART.
  JP5 must be jumpped to USART.
