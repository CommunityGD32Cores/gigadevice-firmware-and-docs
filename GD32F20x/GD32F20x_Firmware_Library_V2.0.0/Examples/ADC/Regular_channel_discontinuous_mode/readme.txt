  This demo is based on the GD32207i-EVAL board, it shows how to use the
ADC discontinuous mode. The ADC is configured in discontinuous mode, group
length is 8, conversion length is 3, using software trigger. Every trigger 
converts 3 channels.

  You can use the watch window to see the conversion result.
