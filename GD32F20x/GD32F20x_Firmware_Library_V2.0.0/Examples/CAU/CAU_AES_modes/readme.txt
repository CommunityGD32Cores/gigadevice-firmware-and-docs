  This demo is based on the GD32207i-EVAL board, it shows how to use the 
CAU peripheral to encrypt and decrypt data using AES in chaining modes
(ECB, CBC, CTR) and all key sizes (128, 192, 256) Algorithm.
  The all data can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the USART.
  JP5 must be jumpped to USART.
